Description:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This dataset contains EEG recordings captured during imagined mental command. The data was collected to support the development and training of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems that aim to classify directional intentions—such as left, right, up, and down—based on non-invasive EEG signals. 
Data were recorded at a sampling frequency of 128 Hz from 50 subjects in a controlled environment, using the EMOTIV Epoc X headset along with Emotiv software tools. Each participant followed a structured protocol and was guided through a series of trials involving specific imagined commands. 
The recordings were collected under consistent and carefully monitored conditions to ensure high data quality and uniformity across sessions.

Acquisition Protocol:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before each session, subjects were fitted with the EMOTIV Epoc X headset, ensuring optimal electrode contact using a saline solution. The EmotivBCI platform was used for mental task training, and EmotivPro was used for data acquisition. Each subject underwent a baseline recording (eyes open/closed), followed by mental task recordings for four commands: left, right, up, and down.

Each mental command was trained and validated using EmotivBCI. Training sessions included multiple trials until each command reached a minimum EEG strength threshold of 75%. Once validated, the commands were recorded via EmotivPro across 10 trials per task. Each trial lasted between 8 to 10 seconds, with rest intervals in between to reduce fatigue.

All recordings were conducted in a quiet, isolated environment to avoid auditory and visual distractions. EEG data was captured from 14 channels based on the international 10–20 system, and stored in `.csv` format.

Mental Command:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each EEG trial includes additional metadata for interpreting the subject’s cognitive state during recording. This metadata is structured into the following fields:

- **MC.Action** – Encodes the mental task performed:
  - 1   – Neutral (Baseline)  
  - 8   – Up  
  - 16  – Down  
  - 32  – Left  
  - 64  – Right  

- **MC.ActionPower** – A float between 0 and 1 representing the intensity of the detected mental command. Values closer to 1 indicate stronger, more reliable mental activation.

- **MC.IsActive** – Indicates whether a mental command was actively detected:
  - 1 – Mental command is active  
  - 0 – No active command (neutral state)

Note:
Each subject's file includes EEG recordings across the 14 EMOTIV channels:  
AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4
